This website is designed to showcase my interest in joining Vercel and to convey the value I can bring to the team. As someone who is passionate about go-to-market operations and problem-solving, I believe my skills and experience align perfectly with the goals of Vercel. Through this site, I aim to demonstrate not only my enthusiasm for the company but also the unique contributions I can make to help Vercel continue to innovate and grow.

## Template

Spotlight is a [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com) site template built using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). I used Spotlight as the foundation for this website, streamlining it into a minimal shell that suited my needs. From there, I incorporated several Catalyst UI components to retool the site. The site is hosted on Vercel, ensuring fast and reliable performance.
